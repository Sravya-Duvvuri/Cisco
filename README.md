As a part of Cisco's Virtual Internship Program (cybersecurity), I completed various activities in Cisco's Packet Tracer. Along with that a few other requirements were completing the assignments we were given, including analysing our own college's network topology. The project submission, assignments and the certificates I recieved on completing each of the four sub courses are all present in this repository.
